# Reinforcement Learning + Robotics

---

In this project, **DDPG** and **TD3**, enhanced with **HER** (Hindsight Experience Replay)—all state-of-the-art algorithms—were implemented to enable a simulated 7-DOF robot in **OpenAI-GYM** to perform continuous control tasks optimally and efficiently. The robot achieves this by developing advanced **motion-planning** and **path-planning** strategies through **Reinforcement Learning**.
